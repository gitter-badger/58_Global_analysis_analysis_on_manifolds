\begin{document}
Let $M$ be an oriented $r$-dimensional differentiable manifold with 
a piecewise differentiable boundary $\partial M$. Further,  let $\partial M$ have the
orientation induced by  $M$.  
If $\omega$ is an $(r-1)$-form on $M$ with compact support, whose components 
have continuous first partial derivatives in any coordinate chart, then
\[ \int_M \dd \omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega.\]
